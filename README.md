# Mouse-Steering-Throttle-Modes-Artificial-inteligence-
Tsted on 0.24.0 CSP
A Mouse Steering upgrade for Assetto Corsa that adds 40% / 70% / 100% throttle modes, switched with Left Shift (customizable) 😎 Includes a second version where the throttle rises smoothly for better traction (I used AI for everything)
